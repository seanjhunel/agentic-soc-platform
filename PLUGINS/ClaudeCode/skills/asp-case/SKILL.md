2. **List cases** - Browse cases with optional filters (status, severity, limit)
3. **Update a case** - Modify existing case fields including severity, status, verdict, and AI analysis

## Operation Details

### 1 Get Case Details

**Required parameters:**

- `case_id` - The case identifier

**Process:**

1. Use MCP tool `get_case` with the case ID

**Output format:**

# ASP Playbook

Use this skill for playbook automation work on ASP.

## When to Use

- The user wants to know which playbook definitions are currently available to run.
- The user wants to execute a playbook against a case, alert, or artifact.
- The user wants to inspect playbook run records by target object, type, or job status.
- The user wants to check whether automation has already run for a target object.

## Operating Rules

- Keep playbook definitions and playbook run records strictly separated in language and workflow.
- Use `list_available_playbook_definitions` only for runnable definitions.
- Use `list_playbook_runs` only for run records.
- Use `execute_playbook` only when the user has named a runnable definition and identified the target object.
- Do not invent a playbook definition name. If missing, list or suggest from available definitions first.
- Treat `user_input` as optional, per-run natural-language guidance for the selected playbook, not as a generic chat
  prompt.

## Decision Flow

1. If the user asks what can run, call `list_available_playbook_definitions`.
2. If the user asks whether automation has run for a case, alert, or artifact, call
   `list_playbook_runs(source_id=<target_id>, type=[<target_type>])`.
3. If the user asks to run automation and already provides definition name plus target object, call `execute_playbook`.
4. If the user asks to run automation but does not know the playbook definition name, call
   `list_available_playbook_definitions` first.
5. If the user asks for general automation history, call `list_playbook_runs` with the narrowest useful filters.

## SOP

### List Runnable Playbook Definitions

1. Call `list_available_playbook_definitions`.
2. Parse the returned JSON.
3. Present only the most relevant definitions for the user's target object or goal.
4. Make it explicit that these are definitions, not run records.

Preferred response structure:

| Definition Name | Likely Target | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|

### Run A Playbook

1. Require `target_type`, `target_id`, and playbook definition `name`.
2. If the definition name is missing or uncertain, call `list_available_playbook_definitions` first.
3. Pass `user_input` only when the user wants extra guidance for that run.
4. Call `execute_playbook(type=<target_type>, record_id=<target_id>, name=<definition_name>, user_input=<optional>)`.
5. Confirm that a pending playbook run record was created.

Preferred response structure:

- `Target`: type and ID
- `Playbook Definition`: selected name
- `Run Status`: pending at creation time unless the platform reports otherwise
- `User Input`: only if provided
- `Next Useful Step`: usually to query related playbook runs

### Review Playbook Runs

1. Extract supported filters: `playbook_id`, `job_status`, `type`, `source_id`, `limit`.
2. Use `source_id` when the user is asking from the perspective of one case, alert, or artifact.
3. Call `list_playbook_runs`.
4. Parse the returned JSON strings.
5. Present a short run-oriented view.

Preferred response structure:

| Run ID | Type | Target ID | Job Status | Definition Name | Updated |
|--------|------|-----------|------------|-----------------|---------|

Then add one short interpretation line when useful.

## Clarification Rules

- Ask for `target_type` and `target_id` only when missing for run requests.
- Ask for the playbook definition name only when missing or ambiguous.
- If the user names something that sounds like a run ID instead of a definition, clarify before executing.
- If the user asks to "check the run" without a run ID, prefer `list_playbook_runs` with object context instead of
  guessing a specific run.

## Output Rules

- Be concise.
- Do not blur the words definition, run, record, and target object.
- Do not dump all playbook definitions if only a shortlist is relevant.
- Prefer operational wording: what can run, what ran, what is pending, what should be checked next.

## Failure Handling

- If no matching playbook definitions exist, say that directly and suggest the closest relevant options.
- If no run records exist for the target, say that directly.
- If execution prerequisites are missing, ask one focused clarification instead of guessing.
- If the user asks for something only run records can answer, do not answer from definitions alone.
